content3 = "Vincent van Gogh's painting style is renowned for its distinctive and innovative qualities. He was a " \
           "master of post-impressionism, a movement that rejected the strict realism of traditional art in " \
           "favor of expressing emotional and subjective experiences. Van Gogh's brushstrokes are a defining " \
           "feature of his style, characterized by their boldness, energy, and expressive quality. He employed " \
           "thick impasto technique, layering paint on the canvas in a textured manner that added depth and " \
           "dimension to his works. His brushwork often follows a visible, directional pattern, imbuing his " \
           "paintings with a sense of movement and dynamism. Van Gogh's use of color is equally remarkable â€“ he " \
           "employed vibrant and contrasting hues to evoke mood and emotion. His signature swirls, dynamic lines, " \
           "and thick, often jagged strokes create a sense of tension and intensity in his compositions. Overall, " \
           "van Gogh's painting style and brushstrokes are not only a visual delight but also a profound " \
           "expression of his inner emotional turmoil and artistic vision.  The images below show the thick impasto" \
